# Modelling-of-fluid-power-components
Modelling of Directional control valve, hoses, cylinder in Simulink 
The aim of the project was to model the hydraulic circuit as shown in figure 1. The main components of the system are:
• 4/3 Direction control valve
• Hoses
• Actuator
• Boom Mechanism
• Controller with feedback
